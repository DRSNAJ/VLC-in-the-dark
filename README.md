## Project Description

Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers a wide, unlicensed spectrum and the potential for data rates in the order of Terabits per second. This project characterizes the performance of consumer-grade white LEDs and an RGB LED for VLC in dark environments, focusing on throughput, link distances, and dimmability while maintaining the visual quality of light.

### Key Features

- **Imperceptible VLC Link**: Demonstrates data transmission with LEDs emitting light at levels imperceptible to the human eye.
- **Modulation Schemes**: Evaluates the effectiveness of various modulation schemes in maintaining a VLC link under low-light conditions.
- **Consumer-Grade LEDs**: Characterizes the performance of easily accessible LEDs for potential VLC applications.

## Results

A summary of the findings, including:
- **Data Rates**: Up to 90.2 kbps for RGB LEDs and 30.1 kbps for white LEDs.
- **Link Distance**: Achieves a maximum distance of 17 m for high-lumen white LEDs.
- **Dimmability**: Highlights the ability to linearly dim LEDs to unnoticeable levels without degrading light quality.

Consider including charts, graphs, or tables to visually represent the results.

## Future Work

Discuss potential improvements and future directions for the research, such as exploring more complex modulation schemes or integrating the system into real-world applications.
